# Take the bet_sorting table, join parataxonomy table by `subsampleID`, 
# Join that to expert table by `individualID`.  
# Prefer the higher-grade scientificName and taxonRank when available.
# Unpinned beetles in the same subsample inherit the ID of that subsample (??)
# Do nothing if the multiple experts disagree.  

# resulting table has all the columns of `sorting`, plus: `individualID` and `identificationSource`.
# identificationSource indicates if the scientificName was provided by the sorting (sort), parataxonomist (pin), or expert
# 
# The resulting table will likely have more rows than the input table, because multiple the subsample is now broken up into
# individuals always.  (be cautious of what this does to the individualCount column??)

  #           a sample as COLSP6 instead of CARSP14, though, then all CARSP14 from that trap on that date should probably be updated to COLSP6â€¦
